title: "Harris MRSA Hospital Model"
---

An agent-based model for simulating MRSA transmission dynamics in a hospital setting, built with Repast Simphony.

## Overview *

This model simulates methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) transmission within a single hospital facility. It tracks:

- Patient admissions, transfers, and discharges (ADT)
- Healthcare worker (HCW) visits and patient contacts
- MRSA colonization and infection dynamics
- Intervention effectiveness (hand hygiene, contact precautions)

Time is **continuous** in units of **days**, with a default simulation period of 365 days.

## Key Features *

- **Two-unit hospital**: General ward and ICU with distinct dynamics
- **Multiple HCW types**: Nurses, physicians, respiratory/physical/occupational therapists
- **Stochastic processes**: Gamma-distributed length of stay and visit timing
- **Transmission model**: HCW-mediated pathogen transfer with hand hygiene and PPE interventions
