## Architecture *

The model uses a discrete-event simulation pattern built on Repast Simphony's scheduling system.

### Core Components *

```
builders/Builder.java     Entry point, parameter configuration, HCW creation
containers/Hospital.java  Patient/bed management, data collection
agents/                   Patient, Nurse, Doctor, Therapist classes
processes/                Admission, Discharge, Transfer, PatientVisit
```

### Agent Types *

**Patients** move through the hospital via ADT processes. Each patient has:

- Admission time and location (ICU or ward)
- Scheduled discharge time (Gamma-distributed LOS)
- MRSA colonization/infection status

**Healthcare Workers** include nurses, physicians, and therapists (RT, PT, OT). HCWs are assigned to either ICU or ward and visit patients stochastically based on Gamma-distributed inter-visit times.

## Patient Flow *

```
Admission → [ICU or Ward] → Transfer (if ICU) → Discharge
              ↓                    ↓
         HCW Visits           HCW Visits
```

1. **Admission**: Exponential inter-arrival times; patients assigned to ICU with probability `icuAdmitProbability`
2. **Length of Stay**: Log-normal distributed, parameterized separately for ICU and ward
3. **Transfer**: ICU patients may transfer to ward based on Gamma-distributed timing
4. **Discharge**: Patient removed, `DischargedPatient` record created

## Disease Transmission *

MRSA spreads via HCW-mediated contact:

1. **Importation**: Patients may arrive colonized (probability `admitImportationInfectionProbability`)
2. **Transmission**: During visits, MRSA can transfer:
   - Colonized patient → HCW hands (if no hand hygiene)
   - Contaminated HCW → susceptible patient
3. **Interventions**: Hand hygiene before/after visits and PPE for contact precautions reduce transmission probability

### Transmission Probability *

Per-visit transmission probability depends on:

- Patient colonization status
- HCW hand contamination status
- Hand hygiene adherence (pre- and post-visit)
- PPE adherence if patient on contact precautions
- Hand hygiene efficacy (`hhEfficacy`)

## Scheduling *

The model uses Repast's `ISchedule` with:

- **Continuous time**: Processes self-schedule using distribution samples
- **Daily operations** (`@ScheduledMethod(interval=1)`): Reset therapy needs
- **Per-shift operations** (`interval=0.5`): Reassign nurse-patient assignments
- **End of run** (`start=365`): Write output files
